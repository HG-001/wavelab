# ðŸŒŠ wavelab - A Python-based GUI Application for Modulation Techniques Simulation

## Overview
Welcome to **wavelab**, a Python-based GUI application designed for simulating both digital and analog modulation techniques with real-time signal analysis. This tool allows users to explore Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Phase Shift Keying (PSK), and Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) methods in both digital and analog domains. By providing a user-friendly interface, **wavelab** enables enthusiasts and professionals to visualize and analyze the behavior of these modulation techniques.

## Features
- Simulate digital and analog modulation techniques.
- Real-time signal analysis.
- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Explore FSK, PSK, and ASK methods.
- Gain insights into modulation behavior.

## Installation
